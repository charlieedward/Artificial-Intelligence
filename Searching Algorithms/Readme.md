# Searching Algorithms

This project includes search algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and A* Search.

## Description

This project simulates a ski resort, featuring varying terrain with different slopes, trees, and elevations. Each skier has different skill levels, corresponding to their stamina, which affects their ability to climb the next slope. The varying elevations also influence route choices. For a detailed introduction, please refer to the documentation.
